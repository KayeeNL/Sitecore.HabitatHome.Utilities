#### Prepare to install XP
	
	Set-Location ..

##### A bit about the process

The install-xp0.ps1 script takes in a JSON configuration file (defaults to .\configuration-xp0.json) and runs through the entire platform installation, including optional modules.

The configuration-xp0.json is generated by running two powershell scripts. These powershell scripts use a template settings file (install-settings.json) and populates some values.

The set-installation-defaults.ps1 does what it sounds like - it creates the configuration-xp0.json file and populates it with the default values based on the version of the platform it was meant to support.

The set-installation-overrides.ps1.example script needs to be renamed and modified. Executing it once it has been renamed will fill in the rest of the information in the configuration-xp0.json file as well as override some of the default values. 

----------

#### Installation

- Set some predefined defaults   
`.\set-installation-defaults.ps1`
- Create a copy of the overrides file
`copy set-installation-overrides.ps1.example set-installation-overrides.ps1`

- Edit ***set-installation-overrides.ps1*** to set the SQL instance name and sa password 

- Copy your license file to the .\assets folder
`copy ~\Downloads\license.xml .\assets`

> Let's GO!

`.\install-xp0.ps1`
